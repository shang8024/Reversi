CSCA20 Project Report: Fall 2019

You will submit a copy of this report on Quercus each week between now and the end of the project. Each team member will need to submit a copy, so that we can go back and see what you've done over time. Your project may (and probably will) change as you progress, and that's okay, but we want to be able to track that progression.

Project Plan
--------

Project Title: Reversi


Provide a one paragraph description of your project:

This project will be about a game called reversi. We will write it in python. Reversi is a strategy based board game that is plated on an 8x8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks, which have two sides(light and dark). Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. They also turn over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible. 
The objective of the game is to have majority of disks turned up to display your color. This happens when the last empty square is filled. We will mainly divide this project into three parts: Part one will be storing the data(using "-1" for empty space,"0" for white disks and "1" for black). Part two will be checking the status of the disks. Finally, part three will be playing the game. We will use the techniques we learned in lab8. 


What will you have done before you arrive at your tutorial next week?
We will study how to store the status of the disks by learning others' code on github.

What will you have done before you leave your tutorial next week?
We will have our work approved by our Ta's and we will start building our code.

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?
We can use a much simpler game like Tic-Tac-Toe(3×3 board) instead of reversi. This is because reversi might take us a longer time to break through. Another alternative that we can use is write an easy code of counting prime numbers as we originally thought.


  Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>


Week 1: 
We built our group and spent all the lab time to figure out what our project should be. At first, we wanted to build a program that could find prime Numbers, but we soon realized that this was too easy to earn the ambition points. We then did some research and came up with another plan. Our plan was changed and at the end of the week we decided to make a board game called reversi. This would help us test our abilities in a better way.
